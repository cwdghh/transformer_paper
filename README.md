# Transformer Papers

These are some notes for some transformer papers.

For each paper in this repo, there will be a PDF(.pdf) file, which is the original paper, and a Markdown(.md) file, which contains the notes and summary of the paper written by myself.

Currently, this repo contains following papers:

- [ ] AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE (Vision Transformer, ViT)
- [ ] Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention (DeiT)
- [ ] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows
- [ ] CROSSFORMER: A VERSATILE VISION TRANSFORMER HINGING ON CROSS-SCALE ATTENTION
- [ ] Multiscale Vision Transformers (MViT)

Only take some notes on other papers.

Plan to add a code directory for each paper containing the original code and some comments.
